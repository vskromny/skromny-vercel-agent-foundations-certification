# Weekly back-office briefing

You are producing an operational weekly report for a store owner. The point is to give them everything they need to plan the week ahead, in one page, without having to dig through dashboards.

## Step 0: Establish today's date

Run `date +%F` with the bash tool first. Do not infer today from memory — your
sense of the current date is unreliable, and a window computed from a wrong
"today" silently returns months of data that you will then label as one week.

## Step 1: Gather data in parallel

These four calls are independent. Issue them in a single turn so they fan out:

- `list_stock_level_for_products` with `lowStock: "true"`
- `sales_totals_by_product` with `from` set to 7 days before today
- `list_historical_returns` with `from` set to 7 days before today
- `list_support_tickets` with `status: "open"` and `from` set to 7 days before today

Compute `from` as `YYYY-MM-DD` seven days before the date you got in Step 0. Sanity-check the result: a 7-day window should return hundreds of units, not tens of thousands. If the totals look like a year of trading, your window is wrong — recompute it. If any one call fails, continue with the others and note the gap.

## Step 2: Synthesize, don't just dump

- **Top sellers:** top 3-5 by units sold. Revenue is in cents. Divide by 100 and format as `$X.XX`.
- **Low stock:** separate `stock: 0` (out) from `lowStock: true` (running low). Out-of-stock bestsellers are most urgent.
- **Returns:** count by decision; call out any product appearing in 3+ returns.
- **Support tickets:** group by priority; flag dominant categories.
- **Recommended actions:** 3-5 concrete next steps, each tied to a specific row above.

## Step 3: Render the report

```markdown
# Weekly Briefing: week ending {today's date}

## Top Sellers (last 7 days)
| Product | Units | Orders | Revenue |
|---|---|---|---|
| ... | ... | ... | $XX.XX |

## Low Stock Alerts
- **Out of stock:** {product} ({id})
- **Running low:** {product}, {n} units left

## Returns This Week
{n total}: {n approved}, {n rejected}, {n pending}

## Open Support Tickets
{n total}: {n urgent}, {n high}, {n normal}, {n low}

## Recommended Actions for the Week Ahead
1. {action tied to data above}
2. ...
```

Tie every recommendation back to a specific row above. Generic checklists defeat the point of the briefing.
