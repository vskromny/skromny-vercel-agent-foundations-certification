description: Generate ranked, auditable product ideas for the Vercel Swag Store by cross-referencing recent Vercel news, current sales performance, return patterns, and the existing catalog. Use whenever the user asks for new product ideas, what to add to the catalog, swag suggestions, design inspiration, "what should we make next", product brainstorm, or anything about expanding the store.

# Product ideation

Produce **auditable** product recommendations. Every idea should be traceable to specific data the owner can verify, not vibes.

## Step 0: Establish today's date

Run `date +%F` with the bash tool first. Every window below is relative to it,
and your memory of the current date is not reliable enough to anchor them.

## Step 1: Gather inputs in parallel

Issue these four calls in a single turn:

- `researcher` subagent with `message`: *"Investigate Vercel announcements, product launches, and developer-facing news from roughly the last 60 days. Be sure to compute the current date and don't rely on your memory. The Vercel Swag Store sells t-shirts, hoodies, mugs, hats, stationery, and tech accessories. Identify Vercel themes, product names, or moments that could inspire new swag designs. Return a short brief with the most promotable themes and concrete naming hooks, with sources."*
- `sales_totals_by_product` with `from` set to 30 days ago
- `list_historical_returns` with `from` set to 30 days ago
- `list_products` with no filters

## Step 2: Apply noise floors

Small numbers lie:

- **Returns are a "pattern" only at 3+** of the same product.
- **Sales rankings need real volume.** If top seller moved <10 units in 30 days, say "sales signal is thin" instead of crowning a winner.
- **Research themes need recency and authority.** Prefer Vercel's own announcements over recaps.

Stating these limits in the report is part of the deliverable.

## Step 3: Synthesize exactly 5 candidates

Each must:

1. Be inspired by a **specific** research finding (named Vercel product/feature, not "developer culture").
2. Fit a category that's working in sales.
3. Not duplicate the catalog (same type + theme = reject; adjacent themes fine).
4. Avoid known returns patterns.

Rank by confidence. If only 3 are strong, still produce 5 but label the speculative ones honestly.

## Output format

```markdown
# Product Ideation: {today's date}

## How these were chosen
{One paragraph: data windows, source counts, which inputs had thin signal.}

## Candidates

### 1. {Product name}
**Category:** {t-shirts | mugs | …}
**Pitch:** {One sentence.}
**Why:**
- *Research:* {Specific Vercel theme + source}
- *Sales:* {Specific row, "{Category} is #N ({units} units, ${revenue})"}
- *Returns:* {"No clustered returns" OR "Pattern of N returns, addresses by …"}
- *Catalog gap:* {Why this isn't already there}

### 2. ...

## Inputs summary
- **Sales window:** {from}–{to}, {N} products, top seller: {name} ({units} units)
- **Returns window:** {from}–{to}, {N} total, clustered: {list or "none"}
- **Research:** {N} sources, {N} themes
- **Catalog:** {N} products across {N} categories
```

If you produce ideas without citations, treat single-digit numbers as trends, or recommend duplicates, you've defeated the point of the skill.
